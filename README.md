# Gun Violence Data
This repository will house all content involved in my Career Foundry Exercise 6 Project. 

# Summary
The Gun Violence dataset comprises records of over 260,000 gun violence incidents in the US from January 2013 to March 2018. The project aimed to provide detailed information about each incident in CSV format, intending to facilitate study and informed predictions about future trends by data scientists and statisticians. The dataset is intended to address the current lack of large and easily accessible detailed data on gun violence, and it is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the issue and the development of effective preventive measures.
